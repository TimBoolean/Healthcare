# Summary of Insights

In this analysis, I wanted to get a better understanding of the demographics of the patients that were admitted in the hospitals. From the results, the difference in genders is neglegible, and the admitted groups were nearly identical. What's stood out in the results from the dashboard is that when people begin to reach the age of 65 and over, we will see a great uptick of those patients. Longer average stay, higher revenue, so on and so forth. 

From 2019 - 2020, we saw over 50% increase in billing amount. How much can we contribute that to Covid? What can we do to optomize patient experience while sustating companies growth?


# Recommendation

As people being to reach age 65+ we will a rapid uptick in those patients. We should focus on the patients closing the age of 65 and work more closely with the older population as the demand rises.
